This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrows.  The `bug.rs` file shows the code that produces the error, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a corrected version.  The core issue is attempting to create multiple mutable references to the same variable simultaneously, violating Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. The solution involves restructuring the code to avoid this conflict, often using techniques like cloning or using a single mutable reference.
